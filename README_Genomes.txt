README GENOMES FILE

When using iRNA-seq Analysis for your selected genome, you must also align your sample sequences to the same genome build used by iRNA-seq Analysis. Align your sample sequences using the corresponding genome build files listed below.

These genome files can be found on Ensembl Plants (http://plants.ensembl.org/index.html), make sure you are using the same genome build:

	1) AGPv3 (Zea mays genome version 3)
		i) Zea_mays.AGPv3.31.dna.toplevel.fa
		ii) Zea_mays.AGPv3.31.gff3

	2) AGPv4 (Zea mays genome version 4)
		i) Zea_mays.AGPv4.dna.toplevel.fa
		ii) Zea_mays.AGPv4.38.gff3

	3) AGPv4_ctg (Zea mays genome version 4 with contigs included; some editing to the contig names must be done to be compatible, you can verify with the example tables) 
		i) Zea_mays.AGPv4.dna.toplevel.fa
		ii) Zea_mays.AGPv4.38.gff3

	4) TAIR10 (Arabidopsis thaliana genome) 
		i) Arabidopis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa
		ii) Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.41.gff3

Always cite your genome build with as much detail as possible, including the database it is located as there can be some variation between databases.
